# Contributing to Minimaverse

Minimaverse is an independent, community-driven information hub for the Minima protocol. This document outlines how to contribute to the project.

## 🎯 Project Principles

Before contributing, please understand our core principles:

1. **Verified Facts Only** — All information must be sourced from official documentation, whitepapers, or publicly verified announcements. No speculation, price predictions, or unconfirmed rumors.

2. **Transparent Sourcing** — Every fact must include a link to its primary source. One fact = one verified source.

3. **Clear Status Indicators** — All features and projects must be marked with clear status labels: `confirmed`, `in development`, `experimental`, or `speculative`.

4. **Neutral Tone** — No marketing language, hype, or subjective evaluations. Just facts.

5. **No Placeholders** — If verified information is not available, the section should be omitted entirely.

## 📝 Content Guidelines

### Acceptable Content
- Technical documentation links
- Protocol architecture explanations
- Verified milestone documentation
- Developer resources and tools
- Publicly announced partnerships with sources
- Official announcements (press releases, RFCs)

### Prohibited Content
- Price predictions or market analysis
- Tokenomics speculation
- Unverified rumors or "insider information"
- Marketing language ("revolutionary", "best", "game-changing")
- Subjective opinions or endorsements

## 🔗 Sourcing Requirements

Every claim must include a verifiable source. Examples:

✅ **Good:**
```tsx
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
  Status: <span className="text-green-500">confirmed</span> | 
  Source: <Link href="https://docs.minima.global" ...>Official Documentation</Link>
</p>
